An Android and iOS application created for the ESPNalps.com Scoring App Competition. This app uses the API provided by the ESPNalps development team to allow a user to choose from a list of available basketball games, setup what players are on the court for each team and score the game on the mobile device. The interactive scoring experience includes allowing the user to update the score, fouls, shots made/missed, rebounds, turnovers for each player and timeouts and substitutions for each team. They may also delete a wrong event they may have entered. The app was developed in two phases. The first phase was an initial prototype on an Android device. The second phase was a redesign of the interface and capabilities of the app for both Android and iOS devices.
